### Scope

Vital Signs Panel; a grouping of the vital signs elements.

The Vital Signs Panel is a collection of vital signs measurements as defined in the LOINC panel 85353-1, Vital signs, weight, height, head circumference, oxygen saturation and BMI panel.  Some of the measurements in this panel may not be considered as true vital signs but are included due to their inclusion in the LOINC panel.

#### About the Observation.interpretation binding

The Observation.interpretation - The use of interpretation at the panel level was requested by the subject matter experts that contributed to the project.  Currently the only value that could apply to all of the measurements in the panel (and subsequently the only value in the value set binding) is "Within defined limits".  We will add to the value set for this element as we receive and validate more suggestions.  *This element and the value of "Within defined limits" should not be used if any of the components has a differing interpretation.*
