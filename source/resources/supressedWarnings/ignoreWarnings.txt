# US Core has a profile of Device called Implantable Device.  This is a sibling profile and cannot be used as a base for our BP Device profile.
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/vitals/StructureDefinition/AverageBloodPressure').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Device derive from the core US profile.

# US Core does not specify a specific profile for this vital sign.
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Observation derive from one of the base US profiles.

# The Average Blood Pressure example uses this extension.
The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this extension.

# Reason The US Core profile for head circumference is specific to pediatrics and inappropriate as a base for this profile.
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Observation derive from one of the base US profiles.

# Reason The US Core Pulse Oximetry profile differs in structure (includes Flow Rate and Concentration as components) and we feel it different enough not to use as the base for our profile.

# US Core does not have an Average Blood Pressure profile to derive from.
