# US Core has a profile of Device called Implantable Device.  This is a sibling profile and cannot be used as a base for our BP Device profile.
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/hspc/StructureDefinition/BPDevice').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Device derive from the core US profile

# US Core uses the FHIR Specification Vital Signs Profile and does not specify a specific profile for this vital sign.
