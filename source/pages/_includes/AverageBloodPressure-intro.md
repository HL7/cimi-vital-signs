### Average Blood Pressure

This blood pressure profile is used to capture the calculated average blood pressure from a set of individual measurements.  Currently there is not a LOINC code for this nor for its components of Average Systolic Blood Pressure or Average Diastolic Blood Pressure.  They ave been requested and the bindings will be added as soon as they are released.  SNOMED CT Observable Entity codes have been bound to the profile and its components.
