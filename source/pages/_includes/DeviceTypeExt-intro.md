### Measurement Device Extension

The purpose of this extension is to be a means of capturing the kind of device(s) used in obtaining an observation, specifically for blood pressure observaitons.  There is a need to record both teh kind of device (automatic blood pressure device, manual blood pressure device, etc.) as well as the cuff size used (pediatric, adult, leg cuff, arm cuff, etc.).  There is an existing extension, observation-deviceCode that cannot be used here due to its constrained cardinality of 0..1.
