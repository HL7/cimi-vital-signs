The Body Weight profile contains one observation, body weight. In addition, the temperature profile contains the following qualifying observations with associated SNOMED CT value sets: Body Position; Temperature Measurement Device (); Temperature Measurement Method (e.g. auscultation, doppler); Exercise Association; and Sleep status.
Note that the measurement method and device value sets are combined because there was a “fuzzy” line between method and device.
